# movie-list-code-challenge
A developer code challenge for a basic RESTful web API powered by Python and bottle.

This code challenge highlights an understanding of the following RESTful concepts:

 - HTTP methods
 - request & response handling
 - resources

## Background

You've joined a local amateur movie critic club. They're looking for a way to keep track of the movies being reviewed. There's already someone that will build a web application but need someone to implement the back end. You have offered to build a RESTful web api to handle the back end logic and data storage.

## Assignment
Design and implement a RESTful web API using Python (2.7), and Bottle (0.12) to maintain the watch list of movies to be reviewed. The API should have methods to:

* Return a list of Movies
* Add a movie
* Update movie details
* Delete a movie

For full credit, all the responses can be hard coded (no data back end needed).
For extra credit, implement a real-time CRUD with a database back-end using either Redis or MongoDB.
